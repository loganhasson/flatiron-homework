# Hashketball Nests
#
# Great news! You're going to an NBA game! The only catch is that you've been
# volunteered to keep stats at the game.
#
# Using Nested Hashes, define a game, with two teams, their players, and the players stats:
#
# The game has two teams.
#
# A team has:
# - A name
# - Two colors
#
# Each team should have at least 5 players
#
# Each player should have a:
# - name
# - number (like their jersey number)
# - shoe size
#
# Each player should have the following stats:
# - points
# - rebounds
# - assists
# - steals
# - blocks
# - slam dunks
